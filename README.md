# Estrutura de Dados

A library of exercises solved in C for the Data Structures class at FATEC.

## `run.sh` & `run.bat`
Implemented a Bash script for easily compiling and running the C code without the need of tools like `make`.  
* To run any of the files while on an Unix system, simply type `./run.sh X` where X is the number of the exercise to run.
* To run any of the files while on a Windows system, simply type `./run.bat X` where X is the number of the exercise to run.
* The script identifies what file you are refering to and executes it.

## Exercises located in the src/ directory:

### 0. hello_world
Simple hello world as my first contact with the C language.

### 1. ordered_insert
Inserting an integer value into an array the correct position, considering the other values already in the array. Loop and recursive versions.

### 2. recursive max
Output the biggest integer value inside and array using a recursive approach instead of loops.

### 3. rec_print
Print all values in an array using a recursive approach instead of loops.

### 4. rec_gcd
Finds the greatest common divisor (also known as _maximal common divisor_) between two input numbers. Loop and recursive versions.
